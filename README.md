## 🚀 Getting Started (Step-by-Step)

The project setup is broken down into modular, easy-to-follow parts. **Please follow them in order:**

### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Environment & File Sync
[Setup WSL Ubuntu, create workspaces, and move project files to the Linux layer.](docs/setup/01-environment-sync.md)

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Blockchain Network
[Install chaincode dependencies and launch the 6-Org Hyperledger network.](docs/setup/02-blockchain-network.md)

### 3️⃣ Phase 3: Backend SDK Bridge
[Initialize the Node.js API that connects the UI to the Ledger.](docs/setup/03-backend-sdk.md)

### 4️⃣ Phase 4: Launch Client Apps
[Start the Cyberpunk Dashboard, City Simulator, and AI Agents on Windows.](docs/setup/04-windows-apps.md)

### 🏆 Phase 5: Evaluation Guide
[The "Evaluation Script" for professors to grade the project's key features.](docs/setup/05-evaluation-guide.md)
